# Arithmetic Units
Collection of arithmetic units written in SystemVerilog.

## Setup
Tested in Ubuntu 22.04.

1. Set up the python environment using one of (a) Miniconda OR (b) pip:
    - (a) Miniconda
        1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).
        2. Create the environment (only the first time):

            ~~~bash
            conda env create -f environment.yml
            ~~~

        3. Activate the environment (every time you open a new terminal):

            ~~~bash
            conda activate arithmetic_units
            ~~~

    - (b) pip
        1. Check that you have the python and pip versions that are required for this project. You can find them in the `environment.yml` file. If you are unsure about this, follow the instructions for Miniconda.

        2. Create the environment (only the first time):

            ~~~bash
            python -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
            pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            ~~~

        3. Activate the environment (every time you open a new terminal):

            ~~~bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ~~~

2. Install the [Icarus Verilog](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/) simulator. In
Ubuntu, you can do this with:

    ~~~bash
    sudo apt install iverilog
    ~~~

## Running the Tests
The test setup is based on [cocotb](https://www.cocotb.org/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). You can find all the tests in the `test` folder.

To run the tests, run:

~~~bash
pytest
~~~

If you want the detailed output, run:

~~~bash
pytest -rA -v
~~~
